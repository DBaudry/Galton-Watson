# Properties of Galton-Watson process

This notebook summarizes my research work for the entry exams of the most prestigious French Engineering school (Travaux d'Initiative Personnelle encadr√©e in in French, TIPE).

This is a simple study of the mathematical properties of the Galton Watson process, along with some simulations.
This process is a Markov Chain that has historically been used for genealogy problem, a detailed description is available on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton%E2%80%93Watson_process)
